# Can NLP and KR Solve Sheldon's Riddle?

## Project Overview

This project consists of two main scripts:
1. `train.py`: For training the model on custom dialogue datasets.
2. `infer.py`: For generating responses using the trained model.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or later
- PyTorch
- Transformers library by Hugging Face
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it.
3. Install the required packages, by using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Model and Tokenizer

Ensure you have the pre-trained Google's t5 model and tokenizer saved in the `models` directory:
- `models/t5_model`
- `models/t5_tokenizer`

If not, use the train command to train and save the models.

## Usage

### Training

To train the model, use the `train.py` script. Ensure your training data is properly preprocessed and available.

### Inference

To generate responses using the trained model, use the `infer.py` script.

## Training

The `train.py` script is used to train the model with custom dialogue datasets. Here's a breakdown of the script:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Tokenizes the input and target texts. Pads the sequences to the maximum length.
2. **Training Loop**: Uses the `torch` library to train the model. Saves the trained model and tokenizer.

## Inference

The `infer.py` script is used to generate responses based on the input text. Here's how it works:

1. **Model and Tokenizer Loading**: Loads the trained model and tokenizer from the `models` directory.
2. **Generate Response Function**: Encodes the input text. Generates the response using the model. Decodes and returns the response.
